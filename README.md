Vim-Colorscheme
===============

This is a colorscheme for vim that I made based off of Sublime's Molokai.

It includes the .vim colorscheme file and a backup of my .vimrc. The latter is
mostly useful for me. :)

It's made specifically with C in mind, because I wanted to use vim on my laptop
for 357 without having to stare at unhelpful coloring. My laptop's highlighting
was unusally terrible, and since I'm used to the beautiful colors of Sublime 
Text 2, making a specific colorscheme for this was a fun solution for my 
problem.
